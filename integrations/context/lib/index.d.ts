 * `assistant/attempt.data.stream`), matching the harness's own
 * session-stats fold. Durations are wall-clock milliseconds: `wallMs` sums
 * whole steps, `ttftMs` the step-start → decode-start slice (the model wait)
 * and `genMs` the decode-start → assistant-message slice (the generation) —
 * both only over calls whose stream carried a token delta, `toolsMs` the sum

 * The decode window opens at the first OBSERVABLE instant — the first token,
 * or an earlier `block-start` marker the token packing could not stamp (a

 * would charge the marker-tiled window to the wait as well, double-counting

 * arguments). Each marker owns the interval up to the next one (the last one
 * up to the assistant message), so the three tile the marker span — exactly
 * `genMs` when the first marker leads the first token (the window opens
 * there); when the first marker sits marginally PAST the token the lead-in
 * gap stays inside `genMs` unattributed, so the buckets never exceed it.
 * They are ADDITIVE-OPTIONAL: cached projection rows written before
 * the split carry `genMs` without them, so the card falls back to the
