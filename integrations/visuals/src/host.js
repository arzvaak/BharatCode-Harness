Write a fenced block with language visual. Its first line selects the type; optional title, unit and caption lines follow. Put the visual beside the idea it explains. Label illustrative numbers as illustrative; never invent factual measurements. These are explanatory graphics, not executable code.

Use simple labelled nodes and --> or -->|label| arrows for compact explanatory processes. Use a mermaid fence for more complex flowcharts, including subgraphs, or for any other Mermaid diagram family.

Use at most eight metrics, eight donut slices, six line series, sixty rows or points. All numeric chart values are plain finite numbers without currency signs or thousands separators; put units on the unit line. Line series must have one value per x-axis label. Metrics can show formatted numbers with units. Captions can explain source attribution or uncertainty.
The full locally bundled Mermaid engine also renders mermaid fences. Choose sequenceDiagram for interactions, erDiagram for database relationships, classDiagram for classes, stateDiagram-v2 for lifecycles, mindmap for hierarchies, gantt for schedules, journey for experiences, quadrantChart for priorities, requirementDiagram for requirements, gitGraph for branches, C4Context/C4Container for software architecture, sankey-beta for flows, block-beta for blocks, packet-beta for packets, kanban for boards, architecture-beta for infrastructure, radar-beta for multivariate comparisons, treemap-beta for nested quantities, and native Mermaid flowchart, pie, timeline and xychart-beta syntax. ZenUML and additional Mermaid 12.1 families are available too. Use valid standard Mermaid syntax, with brief labels and no scripts, external images, remote styles or click actions. Write explanations in the user's language. Do not add an init/config directive: styling is automatic.`;
